{% include base_path %}
I'm a research scientist at IBM Research. I'm also an adjunct senior lecturer, visiting professor and co-supervisor at UKP Lab-TU Darmstadt. My primary research interest lies in the area of natural language processing (NLP), with a particular focus on language understanding in the discourse level, computational argumentation, and scholarly document processing. For more details, see my [publications](https://yufanghou.github.io/publications/).

I am a member of the standing review committee of [TACL](http://www.transacl.org/). I also serve as a standing reviewer of [Computational Linguistics (CL) journal](http://cljournal.org/). I have co-organized [the 8th Workshop on Argument Mining](https://2021.argmining.org/), the Second/Third/Fourth Workshop on Simple and Efficient Natural Language Processing ([SustaiNLP 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/sustainlp2021/home), [SustailNLP2022](https://sites.google.com/view/sustainlp2022/home), [SustailNLP2023](https://sites.google.com/view/sustainlp2023/home)), [the First Workshop on Argumentation Knowledge Graphs](https://argkg21.argmining.org/), and [the First Quantitative Summarization â€“ Key Point Analysis Shared Task](https://github.com/ibm/KPA_2021_shared_task).
