I'm a founding professor for Natural Language Processing at [IT:U - Interdisciplinary Transformation University Austria](https://it-u.at/en/). I'm also a research scientist at [IBM Research Europe - Ireland](https://research.ibm.com/labs/ireland). Previously, I was an adjunct senior lecturer, visiting professor and co-supervisor at [UKP Lab-TU Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp). 

<!--I have a strong background in discourse processing, computational argumentation, fact-checking, scholarly document processing, and information extraction. -->

At IT:U, I lead the NLP group with a strong focus on large language model (LLM) governance, cross-document NLP, knowledge and reasoning, and human-centred NLP applications for education, social sciences, humanities, and scientific discovery. The broad research goal of the IT:U NLP Lab is to develop robust and trustworthy NLP technologies to improve human-AI and human-human interactions, and to sovle real-world problems.

<!--I'm a research scientist at IBM Research. I'm also an adjunct senior lecturer, visiting professor and co-supervisor at UKP Lab-TU Darmstadt. My primary research interest lies in the area of natural language processing (NLP), with a particular focus on language understanding in the discourse level, computational argumentation, and scholarly document processing. For more details, see my [publications](https://yufanghou.github.io/publications/).

I am a member of the standing review committee of [TACL](http://www.transacl.org/). I also serve as a standing reviewer of [Computational Linguistics (CL) journal](http://cljournal.org/). I have %
co-organized [the 8th Workshop on Argument Mining](https://2021.argmining.org/), the Second/Third/Fourth Workshop on Simple and Efficient Natural Language Processing ([SustaiNLP 2021](https://%
